# DATAJAM-CIC 2017

Classifier made for DataJam, a Data Science Hackathon, held at Cluster Innovation Center. The dataset contains songs with 13 parameters like the title, loudness, key, danceability and the target variable, Genre. The Classifier predicts the genre of the song when given 11 parameters (13-title-genre). 

Decision Trees are used for classification, hyperparameter tuning is yet to be done. Multiple Classification algorithms were tried but Decision Trees turned out to be the best for this model.

Because of my inability to tune hyperparamers efficiently, I got the lowest accuracy in the competition and, thus, the last position (i.e 5th) :P
